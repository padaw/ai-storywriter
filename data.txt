The Mysterious Letter

--

Emma loved rainy days. She sat by the window with a cup of tea, watching the raindrops slide down the glass. It was a perfect day for reading. She picked up her book, but just as she opened it, the doorbell rang.
She wasn’t expecting anyone. Curious, she walked to the door and opened it. There was no one outside. Only a small, white envelope lay on the welcome mat.
Emma picked it up and looked around, but the street was empty. She stepped inside and carefully opened the envelope. Inside was a note, written in elegant handwriting:
"Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Trust me."
Emma’s heart skipped a beat. Who had sent this? And why?
She thought for a moment. The old oak tree was in the park near her house. It was a quiet place, especially at night. Should she go? It could be dangerous… but it could also be something exciting.
Emma took a deep breath and looked at the note again. She had a decision to make.

What should Emma do next?

--

Go to the old oak tree at midnight
Ignore the letter and stay home
Ask a friend for help
