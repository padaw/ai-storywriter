# ai-storywriter

A simple project I made for one of my ELT classes that uses Google Gemini AI to write a story through user choices (like a very primitive CYOA game).

### Disclaimer

The API Key I used is of a free plan and as it's essentially a single-use app that I'll only be using in my microteaching task, I didn't go through the trouble of setting up a server to handle API requests through. I might do that when/if I continue working on it in the future.
