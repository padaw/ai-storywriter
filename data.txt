The Mysterious Letter

--

Emma loved rainy days. She sat by the window with a cup of tea. She watched the rain fall outside. It was a good day to read a book. She picked up her book, but then the doorbell rang.
Emma wasn’t waiting for anyone. She felt curious, so she went to the door and opened it. No one was there. But she saw a small, white envelope on the floor. Emma picked it up and looked around. The street was empty.
She went inside and opened the envelope. Inside, there was a note. The writing was beautiful. It said:
“Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Trust me.”
Emma’s heart beat fast. Who sent this? Why? She thought about it. The old oak tree was in the park near her house. It was very quiet at night. Should she go? Maybe it was dangerous… but maybe it was exciting.
Emma took a deep breath. She looked at the note again. She needed to decide.

What should Emma do next?

--

Go to the old oak tree at midnight
Ignore the letter and stay home
Ask a friend for help
